# How to contribute to Petriflow

Petriflow is low code language to build web application that can be deployed on single machine or cloud environtment.
Intetion of the language development and research is to remove gap between standard programming languages (like Java, C, Javascript etc.)
and business world.

Every feature in Petriflow language must have a clear intetion to push the language forward to the ultimate goal, to be the best low code language
that can be used by veteran programmer as well as ordenary citizen who wants to solved their problem quickly and easely.

kind, help make Petriflow a community where new faces feel welcome and old hands feel appreciated.

* Report a bug. If you've found something that doesn't work or doesn't make sense, let us know.
* Suggest a new feature.
* Make a great Petriflow process we can add to our examples
* Create your own implementation of Petriflow

### Reporting bugs

If you've found a bug in the specification or in the Petriflow xsd schema, let us know about it.
* Search the [Issues](https://github.com/netgrif/petriflow/issues) to check we're not already tracking it.
* If you can't find an open issue that describes your problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/netgrif/petriflow/issues/new).
  * Include a **title and clear description**
  * Describe:
    * What you did (ideally with a code sample)
    * What you expected to happen
    * What actually happened, including any error messages or program output.

### Fixing Bugs

If you've fixed an open bug - awesome! You're a true Petriflow developer.
*  Open a new GitHub pull request with your patch. Pull requests should include:
   * The fix itself
   * One or more example cases in the form of Petriflow process files the bug, that 
   should FAIL on an unpatched implementation and PASS with your patch in place.
   * Updates to any associated documentation or examples
 
### Contributing Features

If you've got a great idea for the Petriflow language feature, start by checking 
[issues](https://github.com/netgrif/petriflow/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to check we're not already tracking it, or that your idea
hasn't already been rejected.

If not, start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/netgrif/petriflow/issues/new) that describes your idea.
Do not be affraid of regection, every excelent idea has to start somewhere. Give it a well discrebe solution to problem what your proposition is trying to solve.

Remember, a good Petriflow feature is one that extends the capabilities of the language *and* allows developers to further enahnce their applications.
