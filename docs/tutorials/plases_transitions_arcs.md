# Places, Transitions & Arcs

## What you will build

You will build a simple Petriflow model composed of only three basic components: places, transitions and arcs. Petriflow (the name is composed of **Petri** nets & Work**flow**) is based on Petri nets and is a language meant to create understandable and easy to make Workflow models. In this tutorial, you will create a simple Petriflow model of a bus driver taking max. 5 people. Alongside this, you will find out everything important about three basic components.

## What you will need

* 10 - 15 minutes
* Netgrif SDK already installed
* Access to the internet for [builder.netgrif.com](https://builder.netgrif.com) site

## Tutorial

### Building blocks of Petri nets

Petri nets are composed of two main components.
**Transitions (squares)** and **places (circles)**.
A place can contain **tokens (resources of places, a discrete number of marks).**

### Basic rules

Transitions and places are connected with **arc (directed line)**.
Arcs can connect **places with transitions** or **transitions with places**.

</p>

It is **impossible** to **connect the transition with transition** or **place with the place**.
This is due to the fact that Petri Nets are [bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).

</p>

You can connect multiple places with one transition.
Same way you can connect multiple places with one transition.

In classical Petri nets, firing a transition is one atomic event.
During this event, a **transition consumes tokens from connected input places and produce tokens to output places**.
The number of consumed and produced tokens is according to the firing rule in original Petri nets. For more info please consider reading <a href="https://netgrif.com/petriflow-rapid-language-for-modelling-petri-nets-with-roles-and-data-fields/">our research paper on this topic</a>.

</p>

Transitions in Petri nets are executable only in the case that all basic firing conditions are fulfilled.
As we can see places **p26** and **p27** both contain a single token. Thatâ€™s enough to make transition executable.

</p>

In this case we can see, that transition is **not executable** because place **p1 is missing a token**.
Transition will **not** be **executable** until both places **p1** and **p2** **contain at least one token**.

The basic characteristic of arcs is their **multiplicity** (cardinality). The **default multiplicity** of **every arc is one**. That can be changed to any discrete number.

_Firing rules with multiplicity_

**Input places** have to contain **at least as many tokens** as the **multiplicity of** the corresponding **input arc**.

**Transition removes** as many **tokens** from **input places** as the **multiplicity of** the **corresponding input arc**.

**Transition creates** as many **tokens** in **output places** as the **multiplicity of** the **corresponding output arc**.

    <img src="_media/plases_transitions_arcs/10.gif" height="220">
</p>

Arcs can be used between **place and transition** in **both directions** in the **same pair**.

During the **firing event** token from the place is taken by **input arc**, but in this case, it is also **given back** by **output arc**.

All other basic rules are applied even in this case, e.g. multiplicity of arc.

## Example

<p align="center">
    <img src="_media/plases_transitions_arcs/13.gif">
<p align="center">

An instance of this process will allow you to: 

<ol>
<li>Initialize application by first transition (task)</li>
<li>Decide if you want to use upper or lower branch or by both (each branch can have differnet funcionality)</li>
<li>Join both branches and finalize main process</li>
<li>Wait until at least five transitions were fired in main process and initialize new branch</li>
</ol>
