# Places, transitions & arcs

## What you will build

You will build a simple Petriflow model composed of only three basic components: places, transitions and arcs. Petriflow (the name is composed of **Petri** nets & Work**flow**) is based on Petri nets and is a language meant to create understandable and easy to make Workflow models. In this tutorial, you will create a simple Petriflow model of a bus driver taking max. 5 people. Alongside this, you will find out everything important about three basic components.

##What you will need
<ul>
    <li>10 - 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Netgrif SDK already installed</li>
    <li>Access to the internet for builder.netgrif.com site</li>
</ul>

##Tutorial
Petri nets are composed of two main components.

**Transitions (squares)** and **places (circles)**.
    
A place can contain **tokens (resources of places, a discrete number of marks).**
